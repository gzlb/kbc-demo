# Sphinx Demo

This repository can serve as a template of a possible way of incorporating Sphinx as a tool for documentation in the Python library. The Sphinx documentation for this repository is hosted [here](https://gzlb.github.io/kbc-demo/) but it can also be hosted locally. The main benefit of using a tool as Sphinx are the following: 

- Sphinx can dynamically generate html files based on docstrings
- The documentation itself is extremely easy to navigate and lucid, an alphabetical index is automatically generated together with a search bar  
- Sphinx has a user friendly CLI, check for example the official documentation [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
- There is ample room for customization

I benefited also from [this](https://olgarithms.github.io/sphinx-tutorial/docs/7-hosting-on-github-pages.html) immensely, which provides a good overview on integrating Github Pages to host the documentation.
